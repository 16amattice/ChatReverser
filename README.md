# ChatReverser
A Spigot Plugin that turns your text backwards. xD
                                                                    Chat Reverser
                                        In one command, you can make all your text in chat appear backwards!
                                                              Example: !looc si siht wow
                                                               Normal: Wow this is cool!

                                                               Now Supports Color Coding!

                                                                       /reverse

Collaberators/Authors: Thanks so much to prognostication for rewriting my code to be more efficient!
Thanks for all your help! I am a newer developer, and I definitely made a lot of mistakes in my code and with not giving you credit when it was due. I hope I can make up for it now and ultimately make me a better developer in the future!
